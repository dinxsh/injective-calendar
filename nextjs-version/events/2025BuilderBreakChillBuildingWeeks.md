## 🎯 **1. Campaign Overview**

> Light building, easy participation, strong community pull-in.
> 

## 🧩 **2. Theme & Positioning**

**Theme:** *2025 Builder Break — Chill Building Weeks*

**Duration:** December 5 → December 19

**Tone:** relaxed, playful, year-end holiday vibe

**Visual Identity:** **Ninja Labs style** (Injective logo in supporting role)

## 🛠 **3. Participation Format**

### **① Join the Ninja Labs Chinese Community**

Participants complete one onboarding step before building:

- Follow the official WeChat public account
- Join the Ninja Labs Chinese community (TG / WeChat group)

### **② Build Something Small**

Participants choose one of the two paths:

**Path A — iBuild**

- Beginner-friendly
- ING credits will be provided
- Build a simple page / component / mini showcase

**Path B — Custom Build**

- For experienced builders
- Create a simple Injective-related page, tool, or mini demo

### **③ Publish a Short Post**

Participants publish a short public post that includes:

- What they built
- How they built it
- A link or screenshot of their work

This helps bring exposure and encourages more newcomers to join.

## **❓ 4. Build Requirements**

Participants are required to create a **small Injective-related project** during the campaign.

The build should be lightweight, easy to complete, and focused on helping newcomers explore the Injective ecosystem.

Your submission can be made with **iBuild** or your own preferred tools.

No complex coding or on-chain integration is required.

A valid build must meet the following criteria:

1. **It is visually presentable** (a simple page, component, or mini demo).
2. **It has a clear connection to Injective or Ninja Labs**
    
    (for example: an introduction page, ecosystem overview, or a simple showcase).
    
3. **It can be shared publicly** via a link or screenshot.
4. **It is created specifically for this campaign**.
5. **It reflects your own understanding of Injective**
    
    — even a basic overview is acceptable.
