# **Ninja Break — Chill Building Weeks**

## 🌟 **What This Event Is**

This is a two-week community event where you build something small related to the Injective ecosystem, share it with others, and join a group of builders who enjoy creating simple projects during the holiday season.

The goal is to give newcomers an easy way to try building while getting to know the Ninja Labs Chinese community.

You do not need deep coding skills.

You can join even if it is your first time building anything.

## 📅 **Event Dates**

**December 5 → December 19**

During these two weeks you only need to finish a small build and publish a short post.

## 🛠 **Build Requirements**

Participants are required to create a **small Injective-related project** during the campaign.

The build should be lightweight, easy to complete, and focused on helping newcomers explore the Injective ecosystem.

Your submission can be made with **iBuild** or your own preferred tools.

No complex coding or on-chain integration is required.

A valid build must meet the following criteria:

1. **It is visually presentable** (a simple page, component, or mini demo).
2. **It has a clear connection to Injective or Ninja Labs**
    
    (for example: an introduction page, ecosystem overview, or a simple showcase).
    
3. **It can be shared publicly** via a link or screenshot.
4. **It is created specifically for this campaign**.
5. **It reflects your own understanding of Injective**
    
    — even a basic overview is acceptable.
    

## 💡 **Ten Build Ideas You Can Use Directly**

These ideas are simple, beginner-friendly, and can be completed with iBuild or basic front-end tools.

1. Injective Ecosystem Overview Page

Create a simple one-page overview that highlights the key features of Injective as you understand it.

Examples: speed, modular architecture, on-chain experience, etc.

2. Injective Creative Mini Component (Mini Build)

Pick one feature you find fun and turn it into a tiny demo page or mini tool.

Examples: a speed display card, a small on-chain data panel, a micro-game, a quick payment demo, etc.

3. Ninja Labs Community Intro Page

Make a short page that introduces Ninja Labs and its role in the community.

This can be a mini poster, a simple text-and-image layout, or a lightweight info page.

4. Injective Beginner Glossary

List several common Injective terms and write your own short explanations for each.

You can include topics like iBuild, smart contracts, on-chain experience, etc.

5. Step-by-Step Beginner Guide

Create a very simple “Getting Started with Injective” guide with the first steps and basic onboarding flow.

6. Injective Advantage Cards (UI + Content)

Design a few visual cards that highlight Injective’s strengths — such as speed, stability, ecosystem security, or user experience.

7. Injective-Themed UI Mini Kit

Make a small set of Injective-style UI elements, such as buttons, tags, input fields, or mini panels.

8. Injective Event Calendar

Collect Injective official / community events — Ninja Labs workshops, ecosystem project talks, volunteer calls, hackathon deadlines, holiday activities, etc.

Design idea: a calendar view (monthly/weekly), with event cards showing time, how to join (link/QR code), and type tags (e.g., “Developer”, “Beginner Friendly”).

9. Injective Sticker / Meme Generator

Create a simple sticker or meme generator using Injective elements.

Users can tweak the design, then download and share their images on social platforms.

10. Injective Ecosystem Project Navigator

Build a page that organizes Injective ecosystem projects, including links, entry points, updates, or ongoing activities.
