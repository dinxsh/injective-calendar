# 🧠 Background

Injective has recently expanded its development stack with full EVM support, enabling builders to create applications using familiar Solidity workflows, standard Ethereum tooling, and widely adopted development frameworks.

With Injective’s low-latency execution, MEV protection, and powerful chain-level modules, developers can now combine **EVM tools they already know** with **capabilities unique to Injective**, opening new possibilities for building high-performance applications.

This writing contest invites developers and technical creators to explore Injective EVM from different angles — tutorials, engineering guides, architecture breakdowns, project reviews, performance analyses, and more.

# 🎯 Objectives

Through this contest, we aim to:

- Help developers understand how to build on Injective using standard EVM tools
- Showcase Injective’s performance advantages and chain-level primitives through real examples
- Gather practical engineering insights and best practices
- Grow a library of high-quality technical content for ecosystem builders

Submissions highlighting **real development workflows, architecture design, and practical engineering insights** will stand out.
